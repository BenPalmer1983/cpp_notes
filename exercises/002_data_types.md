# C++ Exercises — Data Types  
*Generated with OpenAI (GPT-5)*  

---

## Overview

These exercises are based on **DataTypes.cpp** and focus on variable declaration, initialization, constants, and scope.

---

## Concepts

- Data types: `int`, `double`, `bool`, `std::string`
- Constants (`const`)
- Variable scope and lifetime
- Default initialization

---

## Exercises

1. **Declare and print variables**  
   Create an `int`, a `double`, and a `bool`. Assign them values and print them.

2. **Change variable values**  
   Create an `int` variable, assign it a value, print it, then change it and print again.

3. **Experiment with `const`**  
   Try to modify a `const int`.  
   What compiler error do you get?

4. **Scope test**  
   Declare an integer inside a block `{ ... }`.  
   Try to print it outside that block — what happens?

5. **Type practice**  
   Create and print variables of these types:
   - `int`
   - `double`
   - `bool`
   - `std::string`

6. **Default initialization**  
   Create a variable of each type without assigning a value.  
   Try initializing with `{}` and without it — compare results.

## Extension

Try to use `const` with a `double` and a `std::string`.  
What happens if you try to reassign them?
