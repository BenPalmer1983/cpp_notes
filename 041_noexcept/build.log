==================== 1) Basic noexcept on functions ====================
Function definitely_noexcept will not throw exceptions.
Function might_throw might throw exceptions.
noexcept(definitely_noexcept()) -> true
noexcept(might_throw()) -> false

==================== 2) The noexcept(expr) operator ====================
noexcept(no_throw_func(42)) -> true
noexcept(may_throw_func(42)) -> false
Note: noexcept(...) is evaluated at compile time and does not run the code.

==================== 3) If a noexcept function throws ===================
Calling declared_noexcept_but_throws()...
[DEMO_TERMINATE disabled] This function would throw and terminate if enabled.
Returned normally (no terminate because DEMO_TERMINATE is off).
To see terminate, rebuild with -DDEMO_TERMINATE.

Done.
