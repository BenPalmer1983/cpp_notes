Create an empty vector of doubles.
Size: 0
Empty? true

Add 5 elements using an initializer list.
Size after adding: 5
First element: 1.1
Second element (via .at): 2.2
Last element: 5.5

Accessing elements:
v[0]: 1.1
v.at(1): 2.2  (bounds-checked)

Modify v[2] to 99.9.
Check modified positions (no loop):
v[0] = 1.1
v[1] = 2.2
v[2] = 99.9

Remove last element with pop_back().
Size after pop_back(): 4
New last element: 4.4

Insert 123.456 at position 2.
After insert (selected indices):
v[1] = 2.2
v[2] = 123.456  (inserted)
v[3] = 99.9

Erase element at position 1.
After erase (selected indices):
Size: 4
v[0] = 1.1
v[1] = 123.456

Clear all elements with clear().
Size after clear(): 0
Empty? true

Create a new vector with initial values.
numbers size: 5
First: 10, Last: 50

After insert at index 2: numbers[2] = 99
Size: 6
After erase at index 4: Size: 5
numbers[0] = 10, numbers.back() = 50

End of vector demonstration.
