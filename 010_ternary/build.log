1) Basic ternary example
a = 5  positive
a = 0  non-positive
a = -1  non-positive
2) Equivalent if/else
a = -1  non-positive
3) Ternary with integers
b = -3  abs(b) = 3
4) Nesting ternaries 
grade = 82  letter grade = B
5) Equivalent if/else grading
grade = 82  letter grade = B
6) Ternary returning different types
val = 3.14
7) Ternary inside loops
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
